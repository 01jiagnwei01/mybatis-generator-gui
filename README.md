### Requirements
This tools require JRE 8.0, if you have JDK or JRE installed, you can download no jre version, otherwise
you need download jre bundled version.

### Downloads
You can download no jre release from here: https://github.com/astarring/mybatis-generator-gui/releases/download/v0.2/mybatis-generator-gui-no-jre.zip

Cause github upload release binary is very very slow, I just upload no jre version
if I found it faster, I will upload the jre bundled version.
